I enjoy everything related to software and the people who create it. I strongly advocate for clean code and agile practices. I am ambitious, organized and able to learn quickly.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Website & Projects

I love making new stuff, that's why I created a [portfolio](https://cosmevalera.github.io/). There I share a bit about my professional profile. This platform also serves as a hub for my projects, allowing you to explore and engage with my work. As well as a personal blog where I dive into topics related to frontend along with other subjects.
